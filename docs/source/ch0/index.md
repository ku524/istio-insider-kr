# INTERACTIVE BOOK READING

## Interactive Book

Human beings have developed into modern times, I think, books should expand the definition. As technical knowledge becomes more complex, interactive, electronic presentation methods may be more suitable for in-depth study of complex technical knowledge. In other words, when getting started, I prefer abstraction and simplification, and after going deeper, I prefer to clarify the internal connections.

This is not a "Dive into xyz source code" type of book. It can even be said that I tried my best not to paste the source code directly in the book. Looking at the source code is a necessary step to grasp the implementation details, but the experience of browsing the source code in a book is generally very poor. Instead, a source navigation map may be more practical.

It can be said that most of my writing time is not spent writing, but drawing. Therefore, using a computer to read the pictures is the correct way to open this book. Mobile phones are just a conspiracy to drain traffic.
Most of the diagrams here are more complex, not PPT big pie charts. Therefore, it is basically not suitable for printing out paper books. But I'll let the graph interact with the reader:

- Original drawings, mostly SVG images made with Draw.io: `*.drawio.svg`.

For complex diagrams, it is recommended to `open with draw.io`:
- Some images provide a `Open with draw.io` link, which can be viewed in a more interactive way in the browser:
  - Where there is (underlined text), links to related documentation and lines of code.
  - Put the mouse on it and a `hover` window will pop up, prompting more information. Such as configuration file content.

If you don't like draw.io then just look at SVG:
- The correct posture to browse SVG images is to right-click on the image in the browser and select `Open Image in New Tab`. Large SVG image, middle mouse button pressed, free scroll/drag.
- SVG images can click the link to directly jump to the corresponding source page (or related documents), sometimes accurate to the source line.
- SVG sometimes has typesetting problems, especially the code segment embedded in the figure. At this time, it can only be opened with drawio.

```{hint}
 - Large images are opened with Draw.io. The diagram contains numerous links to the documentation for each component, configuration item, and indicator. Sometimes links to github lines of code.
 - Dual screens, one screen for pictures and one screen for documents, is the correct reading posture for this book. If you are watching on your phone, then ignore me ðŸ¤¦

## Language Style
As this book is not intended for print publication. Nor is it official documentation. So language-wise I am colloquial. If the reader's expectation is to read a very serious book, they may be disappointed. But not serious does not mean not rigorous.
Since this is the first book I've written, I don't have much experience. There is no person to do proofreading and errata with me, so if there is a mistake, the reader can raise a Github Issue.


## Drawing Style

There are architecture diagrams, flowcharts, and other drawings used in software engineering in the industry. From one aspect, there are two styles:
- Neat, beautiful and neat, even pay attention to factors such as aesthetics and color matching; and limit the complexity of each picture, if it can be abstract, don't go into it. This style is more seen in PPT and paper books.
- Engineer's diagram, nothing is detailed, and abstraction is only performed when the complexity exceeds the maximum that a person can understand in a plane. Such graphs are generally of limited regularity and compare engineer cultures. This style is more common in technical electronic documents.

There are pictures in both styles of this book.
