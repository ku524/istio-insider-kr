# ALPN HTTP Meta Exchange






Let's start by an example:
```
[serviceA app --h2c--> serviceA istio-proxy] ----(http over mTLS)---> [serviceB istio-proxy --h2c--> serviceB app]
```

One basic design principle of `Istio proxy` is know the downstream/upstream meta-data of a new connection as early as possible. Because this allows you to implement some decisions as early as possible. 



**For the client side(Outbound) `Istio proxy` :**

If it knew about the meta-data of upstream in advance :
- The upstream is another `Istio proxy` on the same Istio mesh ?
- Which type of TLS is supported by the upstream ? Auto mutual TLS of Istio mesh ? or manually traditional TLS.
- Which application level protocol are supported by the upstream ? http1.1 or http2 or http3 ?

Client side(Outbound) `Istio proxy`  can also make upstream HTTP version decision based on downstream(app on the same pod)  connection too, see  [use_downstream_protocol_config](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/upstreams/http/v3/http_protocol_options.proto#envoy-v3-api-field-extensions-upstreams-http-v3-httpprotocoloptions-use-downstream-protocol-config).



Client side(Outbound) `Istio proxy` can overwrite the provided ALPN protocol list according to the supported HTTP  version by upstream server.



**For the server side(Inbound) `Istio proxy` :**

For example, when a new connection from downstream is accepted by a `Istio proxy`, it want to know some meta-data of the downstream:
- The downstream is another `Istio proxy` on the same Istio mesh ?
- Which type of TLS is supported by the downstream ? Auto mutual TLS of Istio mesh ? or manually traditional TLS.
- Which application level protocol are supported by the downstream ? http1.1 or http2 or http3 ?

The `Istio proxy` which acts as a server make decisions of `Network Filter Chains` and `Http Filter Chains` selections base on above downstream meta-data.





## Glossary

- h2c - HTTP/2 over TCP or HTTP/2 Cleartext
- h2 - HTTP/2 over TLS (protocol negotiation via ALPN)
- ALPN - [`ALPN(Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation)` on TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-Layer_Protocol_Negotiation)



## Cooperation of outbound and inbound istio-proxy



Above section show that outbound and inbound istio-proxy should cooperate to select HTTP version. Below figure show an example of how it work.

- Outbound istio-proxy

Base on the  `istio.alpn` HTTP filter and `Upstream Cluster` meta-data.



- Inbound istio-proxy

  Base on the `Listener->filter_chains->filter_chain_match->application_protocols`  configuration and the ALPN provided by Outbound istio-proxy
